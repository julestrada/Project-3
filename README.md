   For this section, we wanted to take a look at the relationship between pl_insol and pl_eqt.  From what can be seen, the two show correlation.  With the exeption of one of the outlires, it can be seen that wherever pl_insol is plotted, pl_eqt seems to follow.  pl_eqt is a crucial factor when determining habitability, however cannot always be calculated.  If the scatter plot shows a correlation between the two, we can start to make inferences about what temperature might be based on pl_insol.  With that in mind. the scatter plot opens up posibilities into what might be considered "habitable". 

   These variables were two columns on our initial pandas dataframe.  In order to graph, I stored the x and y variables into JSON format.  Doing this allowed me to save as coordinate points when writing my html and javascript code.  From here, I used a javascript library called amcharts.  amcharts provides an interactive visualization that allows for easy data visualization.
